## FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

[DATE]

Dear ___________,

Congratulations!  It is a pleasure to inform you that you have been selected as an exploratory fellow for the FactoryX Fellowship program in San Francisco.  

Your fellowship enables up to [X days / week] engagement and will be active from [DATE] through [DATE] provided that you remain in good standing with the terms of the Operating Guide (Code of Conduct, House Rules and Fellowship Terms). The Operating Guide governs the Fellowship, and fellows are expected to act in good faith at all times to follow the procedures and practices outlined therein.

While the exploratory fellowship is not paid, the purpose is to find an area of work that overlaps with your life’s work and around which we can progress toward a compensation agreement. There’s no penalty if this is not found within the time stated, and it is possible be accepted to a later fellowship although we may give priority to those who have not yet had an opportunity.  If you wish to accept the Fellowship, please return a signed copy of this acceptance letter no later than [DATE].  We look forward to having you join the FactoryX family!


Sincerely,

Tom Chi
CEO, FactoryX
