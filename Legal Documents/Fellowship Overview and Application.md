# FactoryX 
## FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The FactoryX Fellowship program allows highly-skilled developers and designers to participate in a new type of incubator built to optimize the conditions for creators and spin out companies that embody a new operating relationship to society.  FactoryX was created by experienced entrepreneurs and builders to solve many of the systemic problems in the entrepreneurial ecosystem through direct experimentation, learning, and sharing.

Fellowship program principles include:

* Find/build from the points of highest leverage/speed
* Maximizing the Rate of Learning via working in actuals
* Create net benefits to society with each project
* Continuously integrate practical system-level learning into toolchain

Fellows will meet the following profile:
* Skilled at Node.js, Python, Obj-C, Java/Android, HTML/CSS/JS, or UI/UX
* Have the ability to architect for scale, reuse, and extensibility (including OSS)
* Experience working in fast-moving highly-collaborative environments
* Want to participate in and help re-invent the startup ecosystem
* Want to work alongside experienced entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors

All fellows will be compensated via a monthly stipend adjusted to working location and need.  A smaller select group of fellows will work in-residence and room and board will be offered.  Fellowships range from 2-12 months in length, during which fellows will have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects as well as deepen their build and leadership skills.

The following page includes our application form -- we welcome your application and look forward to considering you as a fellow!
