# Legal Documents

This folder contains legal documents we use at FactoryX. Many of the documents pertain to agreements with our collaborators, whom we call Fellows. Here is a brief overview of the Fellowship process.

## Exploratory Fellows
When someone is interested in working with us, we usually set up an Exploratory Fellowship. This is an opportunity for the potential collaborator to understand how we work and figure out how they might contribute; it also allows us to make sure that they are a cultural fit with FactoryX. Once we have an understanding of what meaningful impact the collaborator will have, we transition the relationship to Fellow.


## Fellows
All collaborators are know as fellows. Most Fellows have a combination of performance-based-equity and stipend tied to specific targets.
