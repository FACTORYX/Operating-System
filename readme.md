# FactoryX Operating System

FactoryX is a bold experiment to revise the nature of companies themselves and re-invent entrepreneurship from the ground up. We are trying myriad approaches and want to share what we've learned. Our home is that others will find our methods and materials useful and share what they've learned, in turn.

This repository information and tools that critical to our operations. We've organized them into:

* [Playbooks (Strategies, Tactics, Processes)](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Playbooks)
* [Technology](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Technology)
* [Legal Documents](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Legal%20Documents)

## About FactoryX
Two things that differentiate FactoryX are how we make companies and how we partner with collaborators.

### Making Companies
We aim to create a new company every ten weeks. This involves a regimen of rapid prototyping in which we test the product with users twice per week. Our goal is to quickly build and validate the product, understand distribution channels, and reach early revenue. Then we recruit an executive team, help them raise funds and spin out the new company. You can learn more about our process in the Playbooks section.

### Collaborating with Makers
We use performance-base-equity to compensate our collaborators. This allows us to carve out small projects and work with amazing makers whom might not be able to join us full time. Performace-based-equity lets our collaborators share in upside while allowing us to conserve capital.

## Our Operating System
We've organized our learnings and tools into three broad categories:

* [Playbooks (Strategies, Tactics, Processes)](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Playbooks)
* [Technology](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Technology)
* [Legal Documents](https://github.com/FACTORYX/FactoryX-Operating-System/tree/master/Legal%20Documents)

Each section contains its own guide to the documents within.

## Share Your Learnings
